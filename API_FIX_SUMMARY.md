# API Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Incorrect API URLs**: 
   - Updated all API URLs from `https://live-score-pink.vercel.app` to the correct API-SPORTS endpoint `https://v3.football.api-sports.io`.
   - This affected `.env.local`, proxy files, and the static test page.

2. **API Key Header Format**:
   - Added multiple formats of the API key header to address potential case sensitivity issues:
     - `x-apisports-key` (lowercase)
     - `X-Apisports-Key` (mixed case)
   - API-SPORTS may require a specific capitalization format which wasn't consistently applied.

3. **URL Construction**:
   - Fixed how URLs are constructed in the API service to properly handle endpoints:
     - In production: `/api/proxy?endpoint=status` (passing endpoint as query parameter)
     - In development: Direct API access with `https://v3.football.api-sports.io/status`

4. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging to proxy handlers to help diagnose API authentication issues
   - Added logging to the static test page to verify correct API URL and key usage

## API Architecture

The application uses two different methods to access the API-SPORTS Football API depending on the environment:

### Development Mode

- Direct API access to `https://v3.football.api-sports.io`
- API key is included in request headers
- Headers used: `x-apisports-key` and `X-Apisports-Key` for compatibility

### Production Mode

- Requests go through server-side proxies at `/api/proxy` or `/api/football-proxy`
- The endpoint is passed as a query parameter: `/api/proxy?endpoint=status`
- API key is kept secure on the server side
- Proxy forwards the request to API-SPORTS with appropriate authentication

## Testing API Integration

The application provides several methods to test API integration:

1. **Static Test Page** (`/api-test.html`):
   - Simple client-side test for direct API access
   - Helps verify API key and basic connectivity

2. **API Test Page** (`/api-test`):
   - Tests API access through the application's API service
   - Shows environment information (production vs. development)

3. **API Debug Page** (`/api-debug`):
   - More detailed API testing and debugging capabilities
   - Similar to the API test page but with more options

## Common API Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Error message: "Error/Missing application key"
   - Cause: API key header is missing, incorrectly formatted, or the key is invalid
   - Solution: Check header format and API key value

2. **404 Not Found**:
   - Cause: Incorrect API endpoint URL or path
   - Solution: Verify the endpoint path matches API-SPORTS documentation

3. **Rate Limit Exceeded**:
   - Cause: Too many API requests in a short period
   - Solution: Implement caching and check rate limit headers

## API-SPORTS Requirements

- API key should be included in the header `x-apisports-key`
- Free plan has limited requests per day/minute
- Rate limit headers are returned with each response
- API-SPORTS requires explicit domain authorization for production use
