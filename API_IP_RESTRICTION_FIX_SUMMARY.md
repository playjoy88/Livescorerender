# API IP Restriction Fix Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the Fixie proxy service to route all API requests through whitelisted IPs. This resolves the IP restriction issues with the API-Football service.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Proxy Implementation
- Created a direct HTTP CONNECT tunnel in `src/utils/fixieProxy.ts`
- All API requests are routed through this proxy via the `/api/proxy` endpoint
- The Fixie proxy service allows API requests to come from whitelisted IPs

### 2. Frontend Integration
- All frontend components automatically use the proxy through our API service
- Updated documentation and comments in the code to clarify the proxy usage

### 3. Database Configuration
- Disabled database connections in development environments to prevent connection errors
- Made database connection optional to allow testing without a PostgreSQL connection
- Set `REQUIRE_DB_CONNECTION` to false to prevent errors in development and testing

### 4. API Settings Page
- The "ทดสอบการเชื่อมต่อ" (Test Connection) button in API settings correctly tests the connection
- Shows comprehensive diagnostics including server IP information

## How to Test

1. **Local Development Testing**:
   - Run the application locally with `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `/admin/settings/api`
   - Click "ทดสอบการเชื่อมต่อ" (Test Connection)
   - It will show successful API connection through the Fixie proxy
   - Note: Database connections are disabled in development mode

2. **Production Testing**:
   - Deploy to Vercel or other hosting
   - Ensure environment variables are set properly
   - API requests will route through Fixie proxy

## Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may need to set these environment variables:

```
# Fixie Proxy Settings
FIXIE_URL=http://fixie:YOUR_FIXIE_CREDENTIALS@domainname.usefixie.com:port
HTTP_PROXY=http://fixie:YOUR_FIXIE_CREDENTIALS@domainname.usefixie.com:port
HTTPS_PROXY=http://fixie:YOUR_FIXIE_CREDENTIALS@domainname.usefixie.com:port

# API Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST=v3.football.api-sports.io

# Database Settings (if needed)
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Database connections are now disabled in development mode
- If you need database functionality in development:
  1. Update the `ENABLE_DB_CONNECTIONS` setting in `src/config/dbConfig.ts`
  2. Ensure your `.env.local` file has the required database connection settings

### API Connection Issues
- Check if your API key is valid
- Verify the Fixie credentials are correct
- Ensure your API subscription is active
- For more detailed API diagnostics, view the test results in the API settings page

### Fixie Proxy Issues
- If the Fixie proxy isn't working, you can test it directly using the Node.js script:
  ```
  node test-proxy.js
  ```
- Check the console logs for any error messages related to the proxy connection
