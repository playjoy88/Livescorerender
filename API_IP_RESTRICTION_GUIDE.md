# API IP Restriction Guide

## Understanding the IP Restriction Issue

When testing the API connection from your local development environment, you will likely see the following error:

```json
"errors": {
    "Ip": "This IP is not allowed to call the API, check the list of allowed IPs in the dashboard."
}
```

This is completely expected behavior and indicates that the direct API connection is working correctly, but the API provider (API-Football) is blocking the request because your current IP address is not on their whitelist.

## Why This Happens

API-Football implements IP-based security, which means:

1. Only pre-approved IP addresses can access the API
2. Your local development machine's IP address is not on this whitelist
3. In production environments (like Vercel), you'll need to whitelist the server IP addresses

## Solutions

### For Local Development

There are a few approaches to handle this during local development:

1. **Accept the limitation**: Understand that the IP restriction errors during local testing are normal and expected. Implement your code with proper error handling and test the actual API functionality after deployment.

2. **Use a mock API responses**: For local development, you can create mock responses that simulate the API's behavior without making actual API calls.

3. **Request temporary whitelist**: If you need to test with real API data, you could temporarily request your development IP address to be whitelisted with API-Football.

### For Production

For the production environment (on Vercel):

1. **Whitelist Vercel IP ranges**: You'll need to obtain the IP addresses or IP ranges used by your Vercel deployment and add them to the API-Football whitelist.

2. **Check the deployment region**: Vercel allows you to choose your deployment region, which affects the IP address. Make sure you know which region you're using and whitelist IPs for that region.

## How to Check Your IP

To identify your current IP address, you can:

1. Visit a service like [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com/)
2. Use the test page in this project (`/fixie-test.html`) which will show your server IP in the response
3. Use a terminal command like `curl ifconfig.me`

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your application to Vercel
2. Identify the Vercel server's IP address (visible in API error responses or from Vercel support)
3. Add that IP address to your API-Football dashboard's whitelist
4. Test the API connection in the production environment

Remember that IP whitelisting is a security feature, and while it adds some complexity to development, it provides an additional layer of protection for your API key.
