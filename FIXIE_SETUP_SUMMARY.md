# Fixie Proxy Integration Summary

## Overview

We've implemented the Fixie proxy service to bypass IP restrictions when connecting to the API-Football service. This integration ensures that all API requests are routed through a fixed IP address that is already whitelisted with the API provider.

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added Fixie proxy URL to `.env.local`:
   ```
   API_KEY=311ca0120aa14feefaef14e768723481
   API_HOST=v3.football.api-sports.io
   API_VERSION=v3
   FIXIE_URL=http://fixie:L56rcsBn8mulaUC@criterium.usefixie.com:80
   ```

2. **Updated API Proxy Routes**
   - Modified both TypeScript and JavaScript versions to use Fixie proxy:
     - `src/app/api/proxy/route.ts`
     - `src/app/api/proxy/route.js`
   - Implemented environment variable configuration for proxy settings
   - Added proper error handling for API responses

3. **Updated Admin API Settings**
   - Modified `src/app/api/admin/api-settings/route.ts` to use Axios with Fixie proxy
   - Updated API test functionality to show connection status and detailed information

4. **Test Interface**
   - Updated `public/fixie-test.html` for testing API connections through Fixie
   - Includes buttons to test both the main API proxy and admin settings endpoints

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   cd playjoy-livescore
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/fixie-test.html` in your browser to test the API connection:
   - Click "Test API Connection" to test the main proxy endpoint
   - Click "Test API Settings Connection" to test the admin settings endpoint

3. In the admin panel, navigate to "Settings > API" and click "ทดสอบการเชื่อมต่อ" (Test Connection) to verify API connectivity.

## How It Works

When a request is made to the API:

1. The application retrieves API settings from the database or uses environment variables as fallback
2. For proxy API calls (route.ts/route.js):
   - The proxy URL is parsed to extract host, port, and authentication details
   - HTTP/HTTPS proxy environment variables are set for the request
   - The request is sent through the Fixie proxy to the API-Football endpoint
   - Response is processed and returned to the client

3. For admin settings tests (api-settings/route.ts):
   - Axios is used with explicit proxy configuration to connect to the API
   - The proxy connection uses the Fixie credentials to route the request
   - Results are displayed in the admin interface with detailed information

## Deployment Notes

This implementation is ready for deployment to Vercel. The Fixie proxy allows the API requests to work properly even when the Vercel server's IP address is not explicitly whitelisted in the API-Football dashboard, as the requests will appear to come from the Fixie proxy IP which is already whitelisted.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the API connection:

1. Verify that the Fixie proxy credentials in `.env.local` are correct
2. Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient quota
3. Check the browser console or server logs for detailed error messages
4. If you see IP restriction errors despite using Fixie, confirm that the Fixie IP is properly whitelisted

The test page and API endpoints will show detailed information about any connection issues that may occur.
